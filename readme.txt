Some of the usual edge cases:-

- The game does not consider multiple turns when a player scores. The turns always alternate.
- Player points does not go below zero.
- Coins left can never be negative.
- Inputting the play outcome as Multi-strike when there is 1 coin left will be taken as a single strike.
- Once a red strike has been input as play outcome, red strike cannot be selected again throughout that game.
